This repository provides a step to step use of Bash scripting to build a simple interactive To-Do List manager that allows users to add, view, and delete tasks using the terminal.

**I started by creating a new directory for the task from my terminal using mkdir and changed into it using cd.**

## Screenshot 2: Create todo.sh Script File

I created a script file `todo.sh` on my directory using the *touch* command and use a terminal editor(vim) to open the script file and wrote the to-do list script in the todo.sh file.

## Screenshot 3: Make the Script Executable

Here, I tried to run the todo.sh script using ./todo.sh, but I got a ‘Permission denied’ error because the file didn’t have execute permission. To fix it, I used chmod +x todo.sh to make the script executable, and after that, it ran successfully.
